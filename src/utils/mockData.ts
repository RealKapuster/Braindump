    "GMGM, welcome to another Friday afternoon ApeCoin Community Hour. It's January 27th, 2023. It's going quick. We've got some of the Apecom's members down here in the audience. We're going to start inviting people up on stage. We're going to do our disclaimer. And we'll just get right into the ApeCoin Community Hour. We've got some updates from Workgroup Zero. We've got some new EAPs up to vote. We have got one AIP that was approved recently. And I see one of this week's authors in the audience. So definitely come up here and join us as we talk about recent events and ongoing events for this week. There's our co-host here, SSP. Good morning, SSP. Good morning. Good afternoon. This is a check, check real quick. How's this mic? You sound great. You sound amazing. I'm trying out a new setup. Yeah, it's fantastic. Good. Thank you. Yeah, you're sounding very clear, very nice for now. I'm curious to see some of the grump coming out during spaces today, a little grumpy gorilla action. It'll be happening, trust me. All right, let's go. Vulcan, good morning. Good morning. How are you guys doing? Doing good, doing good. I'm glad you're up here on stage with us. I want to give you the opportunity and the forewarning now. If you have any stats or any special data you want to present with us later on in the space, we'll make some time for that. So I don't want to surprise you later. Yeah, that sounds good. I was actually multitasking this morning looking at some stats during a Web 2 meeting, and I nearly asked during the meeting a question about thank you. That would have been pretty awkward if I hadn't said what I was thinking. Yeah, if you say thank ape to the normies, they definitely have no idea what you're talking about. Exactly. And, Sorg, good morning. How are you doing this morning? I know you've been making the rounds on Twitter spaces this morning. Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, good morning. Glad to have you here. Glad you're up here with us today. I know you always have a lot to share as far as what's going on with the DAO, so we appreciate hearing your voice up here. And we got Amplify. I don't know if you can speak right now, but appreciate you being up here. I know you've been super busy scheduling calls for us among Working Group Zero and with the stewards. Can you talk? Good morning, Amp. Yeah, hey, good morning. I'm going to get in the car. I'm going to be listening, though. Perfect, yeah. Glad to give you some entertainment while you safely drive around without texting any of us. Sounds good. All right, so quickly do our disclaimer here, and then we'll get started into some of the updates, some of the events going on as far as AIPs, and we'll get some insight from the community. As usual, real quick as well, if you can, if you're interested, you're welcome to come up here and request speaker any time in the bottom left corner of your screen. And also leave us questions in the bottom right corner if you would prefer to have them addressed via text. And also give us the like, give us the retweet. Let's try to get some more people in here. Usually get a few extra people up on stage, and then we have a larger discussion. So real quick, we are highly motivated and active members of the ApeCoin community. We are an informal group and not representative of the ApeCoin Foundation through ApeComms, so we can't answer any questions on their behalf. And we're not here to advocate for any AIPs. We are just creating the avenue to share the information with the community and for the community to be heard as well. So with that out of the way, the first working group zero update, and it's really kind of like a three-pronged update, right? Some of the top priorities and the first priority right now is crafting that mission statement, right? So we've got to kind of figure out what we're doing here before we can really develop the structure and the vehicles to get things done. So crafting that mission statement and getting our North Star really set there is the top priority right now coming out of some of these recent discussions with other DAOs. SSP, did you have any thoughts about crafting the mission statement? Such a big question, right? We've spoken about this for a couple of weeks. It's going to be difficult, but it's needed, right? My North Star is needed. I've been a proponent of basically just taking what Yuga Labs kind of gave us in the first place, and then Bad Teeth did kind of mention the difference between a vision and a mission. So I'm interested to see what the stewards and the community at large actually come up with with the mission. What I will say about that is right now we're a grant style, and so again, it'll be really interesting to see what we as a community say ApeCoinDAO is going to be and what our mission really is going to be. Yeah, 100%. I think we've got some different ideas, but I don't think it's going to be too hard to get everybody on the same page and really get some circulation going on this token, put this token out into the ecosystem and create that ecosystem where we can actually have some utility. Can I go ahead and push back a little grump on that one? I think it's going to be pretty difficult to get everybody on the same page, right? I don't think it needs to take two or three months, but I think what we need to at least get done in the next two weeks is have at least something in a pencil version, so we all are kind of heading in the same direction and not necessarily think about coming out with a mission vision statement that we need to basically chisel on some sort of stone somewhere, like the commandments or something, right? So that's something to keep in mind. But my pushback to you, Lars, was nothing more than I think it's going to be a bit of a challenge to try and get us all on the same page. There's going to be some disagreement. There's going to be some, I wouldn't say voting, but there's going to be some pushback here, there and everywhere. It'll be an interesting episode, that's for sure. That's fair. I like the grumpy perspective. You poked bad teeth up on the stage. We've got an orange background up here with us, so I like that. Teeth, what are you thinking? I know you popped right up as soon as we said mission statement. Bad teeth stood right up the chair. You said, wait, let me get in there. Wait, wait. I've been thinking a little bit about this. Yes. No, I actually agree with the SSP a lot. It's not an easy thing to do, but it's not necessarily the whole thing is you don't have to please everyone. You just have to create alignment around something that people believe in, and then they can choose whether or not they want to be involved with what we're doing. That I think is sort of the end result is like, it's easy if you go to any project you're looking at or anything that you spend your time with and you agree with what they're trying to achieve. It's much easier to commit your time and energy to. I think that's really the key as much as coming up with the mission, which will evolve, by the way. We have a pretty solid vision that the ApeCoin DAO has laid down in terms of being this decentralized protocol layer for the metaverse. But we need to add a mission that applies some specifics around what we're doing and what we're putting grants out for and how we move forward. Can I ask you a couple of questions on that? Do you see this instead of being a mission, but being a set of missions? I'll just give you an example of if we take this idea of decentralized protocol layer, that's great. That's a giant vision, but a mission of that could be simply building the tools, empowering creators and developers to determine the future of the metaverse. That starts to narrow it in on specific tasks. I think that as the space evolves, the mission and those tasks will evolve. But if we keep working towards the vision, which is to distribute ApeCoin and support this ecosystem with specifics, I don't know if that answered your question, but it will evolve. It didn't really necessarily answer my question, and I didn't expect it to necessarily, but I did want that conversation to be occurring here on the spaces so others can think about this too. Not that we need to get stuck on the mission itself. Actually, we have a mission conversation on Monday, right? We do. Yeah, we'll have one. The fourth one will happen in the WG0 Discord on Monday at 11am. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Thanks for leading that, by the way. My pleasure. It's been fun. Actually, I can give a quick little alpha update. It looks like 191 got returned for reconstruction in the AIP process, but the stewards and special counsel have determined that we have the power to pursue it within WG0 structure. That's what the plan is at this point. Alpha alert from Bad Teeth, one of our working group zero stewards. Thank you, Bad Teeth, for sharing that as well. Just real quick too, so our other priorities here, obviously running the RFP process to find the new DAO administrators. A little bit more alpha, we're going to be onboarded more officially during the next week, so we will have access to more information and we will be able to really start establishing a clear path forward for these groups and our goals. So priority there, running the RFP process, getting onboarded. And number three here, we have this top three priorities. The third one here is actually transitioning some of those functions as we discover and we gain access to this information, transitioning some of these functions that we can to the community. So priorities in place there. Grumpy Gorilla, any thoughts on the last two priorities? Well, I mean, I think they're priorities for sure. And it'll be interesting to see what the special counsel and the stewards come out with in terms of what we are going to keep in Cayman Islands and what the admins are truly going to do without putting us as a DAO at risk by taking on too much. Because at the end of the day, these positions or these roles are going to be folks with domain expertise as opposed to me just putting up my hand to say, hey, look, I'll run legal for you. 100% different criteria for different roles and not taking on things that might put the community or the foundation at risk. One of the interesting differences that's come up about our foundation is we're kind of here to protect and build on this foundation rather than using the foundation as a way to necessarily shield us from any harm. We want to protect it, right? So yeah, interesting to think about there. A little different than some of the other DAOs that we've spoken to. And speaking of other DAOs that we've spoken to, just yesterday and also over the past week, we've met with some of the representatives from ENS, spoke to Alicia over there. She was really informative. She's done a lot of work with the working groups and setting up the structure there. So she had a lot of information for us in terms of structure. We spoke with Poonkar from Gitcoin. He's one of the operations leads over there. Again, helping us with the structure. They have a similar structure to ENS and to MakerDAO. So they've all got sort of forks of the same structure and we're looking at borrowing a little bit of what they've got going on if possible. We also met with FWB and ConsenSys as well as I think this morning. Actually, no, that was it. The ConsenSys meet was this morning. So SSP, any thoughts about any of these other DAOs? Yeah, actually, I do have a couple of thoughts. And this kind of dovetails into what I know Bad Teeth is working on as well. The ApeCoin DAO is a grants DAO currently, right? Some of these other DAOs that you mentioned, while it's great to get information from them, we've just got to be very mindful. I know that you guys in the stewardship are being very mindful that we're comparing apples to apples and taking what seems to may want to work for us as a grants DAO. Keep in mind FWB is a social DAO. There's some basically DeFi DAOs in there and token DAOs. We're a grants DAO currently. And what I loved about ApeCoin DAO, this is my own personal opinion, is the ability, the broader ability to move Web3 culture forward, given this, let's say, sandbox, to maybe experiment across so many different areas of Web3 culture. And so I want to be mindful that we don't get kind of stuck into a social DAO or a token DAO or just a pure coin DAO, as it were. Yeah, we've definitely heard this uncertainty from pretty much all of the other representatives that we've spoken to about what the final form is going to be. And a lot of these DAOs are still evolving and learning. And oddly enough, working together, even just us reaching out through the stewardship position to these other representatives at DAOs, it's like it becomes clear how interested in working with other people these other groups really are. And obviously, you know, there's money involved at some level with some of these DAOs, so taking everything with a grain of salt. But the information that's being shared is, you know, it's not readily available necessarily if you were just to go and search. And, you know, these people are taking time to help us and to help our community. So it's going to be some interesting relationships, I think, that develop coming out of this working group with other DAOs. Good. Yeah, right. Good. That's part of it. I see Helena's in the crowd, right? That's one of the good things about events, right, is sort of attracting these larger organizations to take a look at what we're doing. Yeah, Helena, if you want to come up here, too, definitely feel free to join us up here. So yeah, again, just some of the other updates here. Stewards are heading up different focus groups. We're delegating responsibilities. So if you want to reach out to Adventurous Ape, if you want to reach out to Lost, that's me. If you want to reach out to Helena, we're heading up the comms, the currently what we're calling the comms focus group. If you wanted to reach out to Amplify or WAPOM, they're heading up the governance working group. And if you wanted to reach out to Bad Teeth or Vulcan, they're heading up the operations focus group. We're really narrowing our focus into, like we had said at the beginning, into that mission statement. And we're sort of coming together to drive focus on getting that done before we kind of disperse back to our silos. But those silos are still there, so you can reach out to us. Another interesting update, I'm not sure that this is actually working group zero related, but since Vulcan is one of the stewards in the working group, and it's something that I'm seeing that's catching a lot of traction on the forum, is I saw that Vulcan, you and Harry are coordinating on the beta testing group structure. So did you actually want to talk about that a little bit? Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. Yeah, so we got our first beta testing feature up and ready to have participators for Ape Talent. So you can go there, go to discourse, check out my post I have there to try out their site and fill out a type form survey to provide your feedback. And then Harry was able to reach out and we're going to connect next week to discuss. He potentially has something else that he's working on, a similar idea and concept. So we're going to connect there and hopefully figure something out. Sounds fun. That sounds like fun. I know Harry's been kind of aggregating all of the community projects for a long time. So if there's a relationship to be had between him and these projects on the ApeCoin DAO, that's huge because he's really, you know, he's he seems to me like a portal, like a, like he just is a path. You know, he creates a road to all these amazing other projects and he's obviously interested and he's here, he's contributing. So I'm looking forward to seeing that relationship sort of continue and move forward. Real quick, too, I do want to just I do have one more Working Group Zero update I wanted to give. We have the first Legal Focus Group workshop meeting scheduled for 1 p.m. PST on Monday. If you haven't joined the Working Group Zero Discord, if you're wondering what the hell is Working Group Zero, why do I keep saying that? What is WGZ? Why do I keep saying this abbreviation? Yeah, I got the tweet pinned at the top. Join us on the Discord. Yeah, all right. Yeah. So, yeah, Working Group Zero, right. We've got the pinned tweet there from ApeCoin. We are a result of AIP 196, the board AIP, and we are working on bringing decentralization to the ApeCoin DAO and facilitating the current administrators who are have been voted out. So doing that, join us in the conversations. Links up at the top. Moving on, we had one AIP approved through Snapshot last week. We had three go up. Very, well, very interesting results, right? We had two creative proposals that were not approved, and we had one sort of structural proposal that was approved. So sort of interesting that we approved one of the potentially more contentious proposals, and we did not approve two sort of fun, creative, community-led proposals that would have resulted in content creation for the DAO, which currently doesn't really exist. But we have Helena and we have Sword here who are on the steering committee for Thank Ape. So, Helena, we haven't heard your voice. Did you want to talk about Thank Ape? We pinned your tweet up at the top. We pinned their tweet up at the top as well. Yeah, awesome. I mean, I think it does kind of suck, at least to me, that we didn't have more proposals that we're able to pass. I know, you know, Anurag has been with us for such a long time, just building together in public and everything. And I really thought that his proposal idea with Atrium, it made a lot of sense. And I was excited to see what sort of stories we could come up with within, you know, the community, the unit ecosystem and the ApeCoin ecosystem. But it does seem that right now we are in more of a challenging environment for AIPs to pass. And, you know, there's a lot of factors into that. Yeah, I agree. But as for Thank Ape, thankfully, that one was able to pass. And, you know, Sword and I are on the kind of advisory committee for that. And I'm really, really excited.",

  Blog: `Exploring the True Power of NFTs: A Storytelling Renaissance

If you're familiar with the world of Web3, then you've likely heard of NFTs, JPEGs, Web3, and all of the other buzzwords that come along with it. With so much excitement and buzz around this new technology, it's easy to get lost in the jargon and hype. But at the heart of it all, there's a story to be told.

That's exactly the focus of the "WCBH" podcast, a show that explores the storytelling potential of NFTs. Hosted by three film producers and a tech expert, the podcast dives into the fascinating world of NFTs and uncovers the power of this new medium in storytelling.

At its core, a great story is all about the hero's quest. It's about a protagonist who faces adversity and overcomes it to achieve an extraordinary goal. NFTs take this formula and supercharge it through digital ownership. It goes beyond just pictures and offers opportunities for storytelling innovation, allowing fans to contribute and benefit from it in exciting new ways.

The WCBH podcast breaks down some of the most notable NFT collections and analyzes them from a storytelling angle. Who are the heroes? What's the story? What makes a particular NFT project a good NFT story? These are just a few of the questions that the show explores.

The beauty of NFTs is that they allow for story innovation, taking classic storytelling formulas and making them interactive. Rather than the traditional passive storytelling methods of the past, NFTs allow authors and audiences to shape the story together. This means that the community of a given project can be heroes, contributing to the development and evolution of the story.

At the end of the day, NFTs are not just about financial gain, but about the potential for a new kind of storytelling. The "WCBH" podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in exploring the true power of NFTs and their potential to revolutionize the way we tell stories.

  Newsletter: `Dear readers,

Welcome to the world of WCBH, a podcast about storytelling and NFTs! Our team comprises three film producers and a tech guy who walk into Web3. We are four Web3 nerds – three guys and a gal – who are passionate about exploring the fascinating world of NFTs.

In the first season of our podcast, we take some of the most notable collections and break them down from the storytelling angle. What's the story? Who are the heroes? What are some of the new tools and techniques that this new genre is introducing? What makes this or that project a good NFT story?

At the center of all great stories is the same quest of the hero, a protagonist who goes on an epic adventure, undergoes struggle, gains wisdom, and ultimately triumphs. We believe that NFTs are being used to supercharge this formula of the hero's quest through digital ownership.

When people think about NFTs, they automatically focus on pictures, but the medium allows for so much more. Think Hollywood franchise that is owned by its fans who have the right to contribute to it, to grow it, and to benefit from it. The story can manifest through all kinds of mediums, such as games, movies, comic books, music, audio drama, interactive theater, and more. And it's all orchestrated through these tokens.

Basically, the great stories told in the past were always passive. The author decided, and the audience listened. The great stories being told in NFTs are interactive. Author and audience get put in a massive blender as we all shape the story together. That means we, the NFT holders, the community of a given project, we can be heroes.

We created this podcast because we've been fascinated with NFTs. As storytellers, we have been taken not so much by the price action, but by the opportunities for storytelling innovation that this new genre opens. So join us on this exciting journey into the world of NFTs, where we explore the convergence of technology and storytelling!

Best regards,

The WCBH Team
