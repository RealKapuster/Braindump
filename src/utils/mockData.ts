    "WCBH! NFTs, JPEGs, Web3, shit and diapers and tires and clowning of all the things. And we can't stop talking about it. Not to be too pretentious, but it's like a renaissance of narrative by making monkey sounds all the way down into their smart contracts. You're Frodo on the way up the mountain. Serious investor. Grotesque creatures. I mean, I just wanted to see the absolute delight. We can be heroes. Welcome to WCBH, a podcast about storytelling and NFTs. Three film producers and a tech guy walk into Web3. That's us. Four Web3 nerds, three guys and a gal. I'm Min. I started out my career wanting to be a Zen Buddhist monk, but somehow life took a turn and I find myself in startups. My co-hosts Fred, Seth, and Sasha. I'm Fred. I grew up on Star Wars. I've been working in film and TV for a long time, producing and developing for Vice Media, Amy, Anonymous Content. Some still say this is a golden age of content, but speaking for myself as someone who has always worked on the development side of things, thinking about what's next, I'm searching for something new. I'm Sasha and I am an idealist. My search for a way to make the world a better place has led me from law to film producing and now to Web3. And here I am hopeful. Fun fact about me, my first NFT was a board ape. I'm Seth. One of my first memories was my dad reading me The Hobbit and me being fucking terrified of spiders forever. But it did leave me bitten by the slightly venomous story bug. I went on to be a TV producer making shows for all of the cable networks when cable networks were still a thing. I then went on to run content globally for Snapchat and helped found the Discovery Plus streaming service. How did I get into NFTs? Well, it's good that I'm going last with my bio because I was definitely last to this party. I only got into NFTs after I read about them in Rolling Stone. We created this podcast because we've been fascinated with NFTs. As storytellers, we have been taken not so much by the price action, but by the opportunities for storytelling innovation that this new genre opens. In the first season of our podcast, we take some of the most notable collections and break them down from the storytelling angle. What's the story? Who are the heroes? What are some of the new tools and techniques that this new genre is introducing? What makes this or that project a good NFT story? First though, how do you define what's a great story? Well, we think Joseph Campbell nailed it in The Hero with a Thousand Faces. At the center of all great stories is the same quest of the hero, a protagonist who goes on an epic adventure, undergoes struggle, gains wisdom, and ultimately triumphs. Whether it's Frodo or Luke Skywalker or Katniss Everdeen, the greatest stories are always a quest against adversity to reach an extraordinary goal. NFTs are being used to supercharge this formula of the hero's quest. How do NFTs do that? Through digital ownership. The thing is that when people think about NFTs, they automatically focus on pictures, but the medium allows for so much more. Think Hollywood franchise that is owned by its fans who have the right to contribute to it, to grow it, and to benefit from it. The story can manifest through all kinds of mediums. It can be games, it can be movies, comic books, music, audio drama, interactive theater, whatnot. And it's all orchestrated through these tokens. Basically, the great stories told in the past were always passive. The author decided and the audience listened. The great stories being told in NFTs are interactive. Author and audience get put in a massive blender as we all shape story together. That means we, the NFT holders, the community of a given project, we can be heroes.",
